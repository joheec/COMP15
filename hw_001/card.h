 * Name: Johee Chung
 * Due: February 1, 2016
 * Assignment: Homework 1 / Modeling a deck of cards
 * Class: COMP 15
 *
 * Class for representing cards in a standard 52-card deck.  Each
 * card's state is given by  the card's Rank and Suit, e.g., three of
 * diamonds.
 *
 * We supply enumerations for usual four suits (Clubs, Diamonds,
 * Hearts, and Spades) and for the usual ranks (2 -- 10 and the four
 * face cards). 
 *
 * The default card (the one you get from the default constructor) is
 * the ace of clubs.
 *
 * Cards are mutable:  their suit and rank are separately settable.
