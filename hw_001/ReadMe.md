## ReadMe for COMP 15 HW1 
## Dynamic Arrays

Every assignment you submit you will include a ReadMe.md file (the “.md”
stands for "markdown," which allows lightweight formatting).

The purpose of the ReadMe file is the same as the little paper insert
you get in a new appliance --- to give the reader an introduction and
overview of the product.

Your ReadMe file for the assignments **must** include:

1.  The purpose of your program
2.  List of files with one/or two-line summary
3.  How to compile it (saying "use included Makefile" is ok)
4.  Outline of data structure (depending on the assignment)
5.  Outline of algorithm (depending on the assignment)
6.  Acknowledgements of those with whom you collaborated or from whom
    you received assistance.

The ReadMe file shows the reader, in a quick glance, what the program is
about and gives a general idea of how it works.  For short programs the
readme file will be short, for more complicated programs the readme file
will be longer.

Use outline form rather than long discursive paragraphs.  A ReadMe file
is an overview.

There is no correct readme format; within these guidelines, devise your
own style.
